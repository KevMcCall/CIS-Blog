                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Top 3 Most Dangerous Threats to Personal Computers</h2>
                    <p>With the constant changes and upgrages to computers, and technology, cyber criminals are always
                        looking to take advantage of your computer security and vulnerablities. The first step in
                        protecting your computer against most cyber threats is being aware of different types of
                        vulnerabilites that could put you at risk, securing your PC against those attacks, and knowing
                        what to look for. The 3 biggest threats to personal computers from my experience are:</p>
                    <ul style="text-align: left;">
                        <li>Lack of Anti-Virus/Firewall</li>
                        <li>Phishing</li>
                        <li>User Error</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>While so many people are now online and using computers (especially at home) more than before,
                        the majority of users are still unaware of the potential threats and how to secure their
                        computers. The majority of computers bought from stores come pre-installed with Antivirus
                        software and are already protecting the user as soon as they start using their computer. However
                        these programs do have a trial period and once they run out, uers will have to setup some type
                        of antivirus software. The fact is many people do not do this or simply don't know how and leave
                        their computer setup for attacks and vulnerablities, such as viruses, which can cause all sorts
                        of problems for the user. That's why it's very important to always keep your antivirus software
                        up to date and make sure your firewall is turned on, to block potential threats.</p>

                    <p>Phishing is another big threat to users and their information. I believe it's important to be
                        able to spot fake websites, emails, and other programs that are build for the purpose of
                        stealing your information and potentially, your identity. Phishing is when hackers setup
                        websites, emails, and programs to mimic the original site as to throw off the user. For example,
                        a hacker might duplicate a website to look exactly like your bank website or social media
                        account. Everything looks legit from first glance, but if you were to enter in your information,
                        instead of it being sent to the correct server and logging you in, your username/password,
                        credit card number, and address, would then be sent to the hacker. This gives them everything
                        they need to take over your account and make your life harder. That's why I would suggest always
                        looking at the URL of the website you are on and making sure it's the correct website address,
                        instead of a dummy URL, created to steal information.</p>

                    <p>As I had mentioned before, technology is more used today than in previous years, however, even
                        with all of the information and software available to protect us, people do make mistakes. This
                        is what's called user error. People are hacked all the time and the majority of those attacks
                        could be prevented if the user took the necessary steps to protect themselves and knew what to
                        look for and what to stay away from. If I could suggest anything, I would strongly suggest
                        people to always keep an antivirus on their computer, keep it updated, and turn on your firewall
                        to block incoming threats. Don't click on links that look "phishy" or any offers, or emails that
                        sound too good to be true. Always remember, companies will never ask for your username or
                        password. So if someone who is claiming to be from a certain company with which you have an
                        account with and is asking for your information, you can bet they are trying to take advantage
                        of you.</p>

                    <h2>Comparison Summary</h2>
                    <p>For <b>performance</b> Acer Nitro 5 has a better performing processor. Microsoft Surface Pro 6
                        has Windows 10 Pro, which is safer and provides more security than Windows 10 Home that is in
                        the Nitro 5. For displaying <b>graphics</b> the Nitro 5 has a lot faster graphics card and has a
                        bigger screen. The Surface Pro 6 is cheaper and also has a SSD, while the Nitro 5 has a HDD
                        storage. The Acer Nitro 5 is a little bulkier than the Surface Pro 6, but has a lot more
                        processing power and comes equipped with Nitrosense technology which allows the user to control
                        the speed of the fans for whenever the workload is a bit heavy. The Surface Pro 6 can be
                        used as a tablet, which takes advantage of its touch screen interface, or as a notebook using
                        the keyboard attachment, which doubles as a cover for the display, or in studio mode, which
                        enables the use of the Surface Pen and Dial..</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All in all, both are great laptops. However I would suggest that if you're looking for a powerful
                        laptop
                        which can handle more tasks as well as gaming, I would go with the Nitro 5. If you're needing
                        something that's a bit more lightweight, portable, using it for basic needs, or graphic design,
                        than I would recommend the Surface Pro 6.</p>

                            is
                            not a physical place or chip, but more of a large connection of networks and servers
                            connected to each other to share information.</li>
                        <li>How is ISP related to the internet?<br> Your ISP or Internet Service Provider is what
                            provides

                            years the internet has become much more accessible to everyone, going from computers, to now
                            being able to be accessed by phones, tablets, etc.</li>

                    <p>Imagine that you're living in the year 2090. Technology has advanced to the point that any
                        inanimate object can function as a computer. Now... Imagine that technology, in your shoes.</p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>Tech Features:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Input:</b> The shoes feature a small LCD display which can be used to change the color of
                            the
                            shoes, loosen or tighten the shoes to your preference, display exercise stats, as well as
                            many other settings. It also features a Micro USB port to charge them. </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Memory:</b> The shoe can record for 30 days worth of data. Every new month is a fresh
                            start.
                            Throughout the month the runner can access all the stored data in a Monthly Statistics tab.
                        </li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Output:</b> Data can be synced to your profile via an app or using the LCD display. They
                            can
                            also play music through small integrated speakers, which are built into the shoes.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Control Unit and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):</b> Both are located in the shoes left
                            sole. The
                            control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform based on the data the wearer enters and
                            the ALU then stores the
                            result in an output register.</li>
